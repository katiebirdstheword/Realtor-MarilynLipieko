                    <h1>Marilyn Lipieko</h1>
                    <p>As a proud Norfolk native, I have always called Hampton Roads HOME! 
                        I have lived in the Willoughby area with my husband and two daughters. 
                        As a lifelong resident of the community, I know the ins and outs of all 
                        the cities and communities in and around Hampton Roads.</p>
                    <p>Prior to obtaining my Real Estate License in 2000, I spent ten years in the banking business 
                        gaining a financial background, where I learned the true value 
                        of investing in real estate. I launched my career in real estate after making my 
                        own personal incestmens as a partricipant in the Good Neighbor Program.</p>
                    <p>It is my enthusiastic attitude, vast knowledge of buying and selling real estate 
                        and continual care that keeps my previous clients returning and referring me to 
                        others in search of a Real Estate Professional. I take pride in being committed 
                        and available to all my clients throughout and even after a transaction has been 
                        completed.</p>
                    <p> Efficiency and professionalism is what earned me the honor of being Broker Agent Magazines 
                        Agent of the Month, and a member of the Hampton Roads Realtor Association.</p>
                    <p>No matter what stage of life you are in, I understand the importance of finding the perfect 
                        place to call home, so whether buyting or selling, I am your key to all of
                        Hampton Roads!</p>
