                <h1>Selling Your Home!</h1>
                
                <h2>Get Ready To List</h2>
                <p> Selling your home can be a daunting process! From fixing that squeaky stair you've lived with for years to
                  figuring out how to price your home, there are a lot of steps in the process of selling your home, and it can take a lot of
                  time and energy.</p>
                <p>Homesellers are facing higher expectations than ever. Today's buyers expect a smartly-pric home,
                    expertly staged rooms, and more natural lighting than a photographer's studio. But with help from me and the
                    I will provide you with a checklist guide; we'll have your home sold in no time!</p>
                <h2>What Is The Value of Your Home Based On?</h2>
                <p>There are several factors that go into finding the <strong>Market Value</strong> of your home. Read below to see what I use to price your home.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Today's Market</li>
                        <li>Today's Competition</li>
                        <li>Today's Financing</li>
                        <li>Today's economic conditions</li>
                        <li>The <em>buyer's perception</em> of it's condition</li>
                        <li>The Property location</li>
                        <li>The normal marketing time</li>
                    </ul>
                <P>There is also a number of things the <strong>Market Value</strong> of your home is <em>not</em> based on. For example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The contents or investment you have in the property</li>
                    <li>The amount you need out of the property</li>
                    <li>The amount you want for the property</li>
                    <li>The appraised value of the property</li>
                    <li>What you heard your neighbor's house sold for</li>
                    <li>How much it is insured for</li>
                    <li>Home prices in the area where you are moving to</li>
                </ul>
